<pre class="fragment">==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
  The I2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a I2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
      I2C_HandleTypeDef  hi2c;

  (#)Initialize the I2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I2C_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the I2Cx interface clock
      (##) I2C pins configuration
          (+++) Enable the clock for the I2C GPIOs
          (+++) Configure I2C pins as alternate function open-drain
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
          (+++) Configure the I2Cx interrupt priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC I2C IRQ Channel
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
          (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive stream
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
          (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx Stream
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on 
                the DMA Tx or Rx Stream

  (#) Configure the Communication Speed, Duty cycle, Addressing mode, Own Address1,
      Dual Addressing mode, Own Address2, General call and Nostretch mode in the hi2c Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the I2C registers by calling the HAL_I2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware 
      (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I2C_MspInit(&amp;hi2c) API.

  (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

  (#) For I2C IO and IO MEM operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :
