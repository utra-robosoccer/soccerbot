<p>When configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS is set to one each task has its own private "notification value", which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).</p>
<p>Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object. Examples of such objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups. Task notifications are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such an intermediary object.</p>
<p>A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value. In that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.</p>
<p>A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the task calling xTaskNotifyWait() or ulTaskNotifyTake(). If the task was already in the Blocked state to wait for a notification when the notification arrives then the task will automatically be removed from the Blocked state (unblocked) and the notification cleared.</p>
<p>A task can use xTaskNotifyWait() to [optionally] block to wait for a notification to be pending, or ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block to wait for its notification value to have a non-zero value. The task does not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.</p>

Setting ulBitsToClearOnEntry to ULONG_MAX (if limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL (if limits.h is not included) will have the effect of resetting the task's notification value to 0. Setting ulBitsToClearOnEntry to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged.</td></tr>

Then any bits that are set in ulBitsToClearOnExit will be cleared in the task's notification value (note *pulNotificationValue is set before any bits are cleared). Setting ulBitsToClearOnExit to ULONG_MAX (if limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL (if limits.h is not included) will have the effect of resetting the task's notification value to 0 before the function exits. Setting ulBitsToClearOnExit to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged when the function exits (in which case the value passed out in pulNotificationValue will match the task's notification value).</td></tr>

The task will not consume any processing time while it is in the Blocked state. This is specified in kernel ticks, the macro pdMS_TO_TICSK( value_in_ms ) can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time specified in ticks.</td></tr>

should be requested before the interrupt is exited.  How a context switch is
requested from an ISR is dependent on the port - see the documentation page
for the port in use.
