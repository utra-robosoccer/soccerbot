<p>A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value. In that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.</p>
<p>A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the task calling xTaskNotifyWait() or ulTaskNotifyTake().

<p>A task can use xTaskNotifyWait() to [optionally] block to wait for a notification to be pending, or ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block to wait for its notification value to have a non-zero value. The task does not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.</p>
