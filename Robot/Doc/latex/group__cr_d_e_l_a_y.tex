\begin{DoxyPre}
crDELAY( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, TickType\_t xTicksToDelay );\end{DoxyPre}


Delay a co-\/routine for a fixed period of time.

cr\+D\+E\+L\+AY can only be called from the co-\/routine function itself -\/ not from within a function called by the co-\/routine function. This is because co-\/routines do not maintain their own stack.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Handle} & The handle of the co-\/routine to delay. This is the x\+Handle parameter of the co-\/routine function.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Tick\+To\+Delay} & The number of ticks that the co-\/routine should delay for. The actual amount of time this equates to is defined by config\+T\+I\+C\+K\+\_\+\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+HZ (set in \mbox{\hyperlink{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source}{Free\+R\+T\+O\+S\+Config.\+h}}). The constant port\+T\+I\+C\+K\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+I\+O\+D\+\_\+\+MS can be used to convert ticks to milliseconds.\\

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
// Co-routine to be created.
void vACoRoutine( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, UBaseType\_t uxIndex )
\{
// Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
// This may not be necessary for const variables.
// We are to delay for 200ms.
static const xTickType xDelayTime = 200 / portTICK\_PERIOD\_MS;
\begin{DoxyVerb}// Must start every co-routine with a call to crSTART();
crSTART( xHandle );

for( ;; )
{
   // Delay for 200ms.
   crDELAY( xHandle, xDelayTime );

   // Do something here.
}

// Must end every co-routine with a call to crEND();
crEND();
\end{DoxyVerb}
