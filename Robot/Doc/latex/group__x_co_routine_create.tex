Create a new co-\/routine and add it to the list of co-\/routines that are ready to run.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em px\+Co\+Routine\+Code} & Pointer to the co-\/routine function. Co-\/routine functions require special syntax -\/ see the co-\/routine section of the W\+EB documentation for more information.\\
\hline
{\em ux\+Priority} & The priority with respect to other co-\/routines at which the co-\/routine will run.\\
\hline
{\em ux\+Index} & Used to distinguish between different co-\/routines that execute the same function. See the example below and the co-\/routine section of the W\+EB documentation for further information.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+P\+A\+SS if the co-\/routine was successfully created and added to a ready list, otherwise an error code defined with \mbox{\hyperlink{projdefs_8h_source}{Proj\+Defs.\+h}}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
// Co-routine to be created.
void vFlashCoRoutine( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, UBaseType\_t uxIndex )
\{
// Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
// This may not be necessary for const variables.
static const char cLedToFlash[ 2 ] = \{ 5, 6 \};
static const TickType\_t uxFlashRates[ 2 ] = \{ 200, 400 \};
\begin{DoxyVerb}// Must start every co-routine with a call to crSTART();
crSTART( xHandle );

for( ;; )
{
    // This co-routine just delays for a fixed period, then toggles
    // an LED.  Two co-routines are created using this function, so
    // the uxIndex parameter is used to tell the co-routine which
    // LED to flash and how int32_t to delay.  This assumes xQueue has
    // already been created.
    vParTestToggleLED( cLedToFlash[ uxIndex ] );
    crDELAY( xHandle, uxFlashRates[ uxIndex ] );
}

// Must end every co-routine with a call to crEND();
crEND();
\end{DoxyVerb}

\}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}// Function that creates two co-routines.
void vOtherFunction( void )
\{
uint8\_t ucParameterToPass;
TaskHandle\_t xHandle;
\begin{DoxyVerb}// Create two co-routines at priority 0.  The first is given index 0
// so (from the code above) toggles LED 5 every 200 ticks.  The second
// is given index 1 so toggles LED 6 every 400 ticks.
