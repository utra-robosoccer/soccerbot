N\+O\+TE 1\+: This function will disable interrupts for its duration. It is not intended for normal application runtime use but as a debug aid.

Lists all the current tasks, along with their current state and stack usage high water mark.

Tasks are reported as blocked (\textquotesingle{}B\textquotesingle{}), ready (\textquotesingle{}R\textquotesingle{}), deleted (\textquotesingle{}D\textquotesingle{}) or suspended (\textquotesingle{}S\textquotesingle{}).

P\+L\+E\+A\+SE N\+O\+TE\+:

This function is provided for convenience only, and is used by many of the demo applications. Do not consider it to be part of the scheduler.

v\+Task\+List() calls ux\+Task\+Get\+System\+State(), then formats part of the ux\+Task\+Get\+System\+State() output into a human readable table that displays task names, states and stack usage.

v\+Task\+List() has a dependency on the sprintf() C library function that might bloat the code size, use a lot of stack, and provide different results on different platforms. An alternative, tiny, third party, and limited functionality implementation of sprintf() is provided in many of the Free\+R\+T\+O\+S/\+Demo sub-\/directories in a file called printf-\/stdarg.\+c (note printf-\/stdarg.\+c does not provide a full snprintf() implementation!).

It is recommended that production systems call ux\+Task\+Get\+System\+State() directly to get access to raw stats data, rather than indirectly through a call to v\+Task\+List().


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em pc\+Write\+Buffer} & A buffer into which the above mentioned details will be written, in A\+S\+C\+II form. This buffer is assumed to be large enough to contain the generated report. Approximately 40 bytes per task should be sufficient. \\
