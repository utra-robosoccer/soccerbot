croutine. h 
\begin{DoxyPre}
crSTART( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle );\end{DoxyPre}


This macro M\+U\+ST always be called at the start of a co-\/routine function.

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
// Co-routine to be created.
void vACoRoutine( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, UBaseType\_t uxIndex )
\{
// Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
static int32\_t ulAVariable;
\begin{DoxyVerb}// Must start every co-routine with a call to crSTART();
crSTART( xHandle );

for( ;; )
{
     // Co-routine functionality goes here.
}

// Must end every co-routine with a call to crEND();
crEND();
\end{DoxyVerb}

\}\end{DoxyPre}


croutine. h 
\begin{DoxyPre}
crEND();\end{DoxyPre}


This macro M\+U\+ST always be called at the end of a co-\/routine function.

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
// Co-routine to be created.
void vACoRoutine( CoRoutineHandle\_t xHandle, UBaseType\_t uxIndex )
\{
// Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
