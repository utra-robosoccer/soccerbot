# soccer-embedded
Collection of embedded programs for an autonomous humanoid soccer robot.

# Common
All the software components we've developed which go into the robot's embedded systems, which are shared between Robot_F4 and Robot_F7.

# Development
Contains development folders for ongoing projects. Examples include developing specific features that will one day be integrated into the main robot code (such as Ethernet-based communication), and developing helper programs dedicated to expediting development and testing.

# Diagrams
UML diagrams for our software (not kept up-to-date).

# docs
Documentation for the code in the Common directory. Extracted using Doxygen.

# Robot_F4
The program controlling the embedded systems of the robot; STM32F446RE version.

# Robot_F7
The program controlling the embedded systems of the robot; STM32F767ZI version.

# RobotTest
Unit test runner (GTest/GMock).

# Templates
Contains C and C++ source file and header file templates and examples illustrating their usage.

# Testing
Contains various test programs serving as "checkpoints" for integrating features as well as other projects for scratchwork.
